    p Alternative documentation system for Adobe ExtendScript API

section

  :markdown
    The people at Yearbook Machine used to make extensive use of the ExtendScript API,
    but found the documentation system difficult to deal with.
    This is their solution to the problem. An attempt at making the ExtendScript
    API documentation more accessible and easier to use than the native Object
    Model Viewer.

    Feel free to [browse the documentation online](https://yearbook.github.io/esdocs),
    or even help us out over on [GitHub](https://github.com/yearbook/extendscript-api-documentation).

    Most recent changes were made by [@tinne](https://github.com/tinne) in his fork, which was merged in to the main
    branch in May 2020 [GitHub fork by tinne](https://github.com/tinne/extendscript-api-documentation).
